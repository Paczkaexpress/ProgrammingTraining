# This project is finding the Kevin Bacon distance between to actors.
# to run this code we need to provide data set (small, large) and names of two actors we are going to look at
# for example:
# python kavin_bacon_degree.py <dataset> <name 1> <name 2>
# python .\kevin_bacon_degrees.py large "Emma Watson" "Jennifer Lawrence"
